🎤 Viva Questions & Answers (High Scoring)
1. What problem does RAG solve in enterprise contexts?
RAG addresses the issue of hallucinations in LLMs by grounding responses in verifiable documents, ensuring accuracy and domain relevance.
2. How does a vector database support RAG systems?
Vector databases store embeddings that allow semantic search, enabling retrieval of contextually relevant information rather than keyword matches.
3. What are the key components of a RAG architecture?
Document chunking, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval pipeline, and the generative model.
4. Why is RAG better than fine-tuning for enterprises?
Fine-tuning is costly and requires large datasets. RAG dynamically references external knowledge without retraining the model.
5. What industries benefit most from RAG?
Healthcare, finance, legal, IT services, customer support, and research-driven industries.


Great question—this is exactly how you should prepare for a **30-mark viva (6 questions ≈ 5 marks each)** 👍
Below is a **very realistic viva blueprint** with **question types**, **sample questions**, and **what the examiner expects**. If you prepare these, you’ll comfortably score **25+ / 30**.

---

# 🔹 RAG VIVA QUESTIONS – COMPLETE GUIDE (30 MARKS)

## **Question 1 (Conceptual – MUST-ASK)**

### **What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? Why is it needed?**

**What examiner checks:** Basic understanding + motivation

**Answer structure (say this):**

* RAG is a technique that combines **information retrieval** with **generative AI models**
* Instead of generating answers only from model parameters, it **retrieves relevant documents** from an external knowledge source
* This retrieved context is then fed into the LLM to generate grounded responses
* It is needed to **reduce hallucinations**, **use updated data**, and **support domain-specific enterprise knowledge**

👉 *Keywords to mention:* hallucination, external knowledge, grounding, enterprise data

---

## **Question 2 (Architecture – CORE QUESTION)**

### **Explain the architecture of a RAG system.**

**What examiner checks:** System-level understanding

**Ideal flow to explain:**

1. User query is received
2. Query is converted into **vector embeddings**
3. Similar vectors are retrieved from a **vector database**
4. Retrieved documents are passed as context to the **LLM**
5. LLM generates a final answer grounded in retrieved data

👉 Mention:

* Embedding model
* Vector database
* Retriever
* Generator (LLM)

💡 *Tip:* Draw a small block diagram if allowed.

---

## **Question 3 (Comparison – VERY COMMON)**

### **How is RAG different from a traditional LLM or fine-tuning?**

**What examiner checks:** Analytical thinking

| Aspect           | Traditional LLM     | RAG                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Knowledge source | Model parameters    | External documents    |
| Updates          | Requires retraining | Just update documents |
| Hallucination    | High                | Reduced               |
| Enterprise usage | Limited             | Highly suitable       |

👉 End with:

> “RAG is more flexible and cost-effective for enterprise knowledge systems.”

---

## **Question 4 (Enterprise Use Case – APPLICATION BASED)**

### **Where can RAG be used in enterprises?**

**What examiner checks:** Practical relevance

**Mention 3–4 use cases:**

* Internal document search
* HR policy and onboarding assistants
* Customer support chatbots
* Legal and compliance systems
* Decision support systems

👉 Emphasize:

* Confidential internal data
* Accuracy and trust

---

## **Question 5 (Limitations & Challenges – HIGH SCORING)**

### **What are the challenges or limitations of RAG systems?**

**What examiner checks:** Depth & honesty

**Good points to mention:**

* Retrieval quality affects output quality
* Increased latency due to retrieval step
* Requires good document chunking
* Dependency on vector database performance
* Context window limitations of LLMs

👉 This shows **critical thinking**, examiners love this.

---

## **Question 6 (Future Scope / Advanced – DIFFERENTIATOR)**

### **What is the future scope of RAG systems?**

**What examiner checks:** Awareness of trends

**Strong answer:**

* Integration with **multimodal data** (text + images)
* Hybrid RAG with fine-tuning
* Autonomous AI agents using RAG
* Real-time enterprise decision systems
* Personalized enterprise assistants

👉 End with:

> “RAG will play a key role in building trustworthy and scalable enterprise AI systems.”

---

# 🔥 BONUS QUESTIONS (If examiner cross-questions)

### • What is a vector database?

> A database optimized for storing and searching high-dimensional vector embeddings.

### • Why not just fine-tune the model?

> Fine-tuning is costly, static, and less flexible compared to retrieval-based approaches.

### • What happens if wrong documents are retrieved?

> The model may generate incorrect answers—this is called retrieval noise.

---

# 🎯 MARKS STRATEGY (IMPORTANT)

* **2 questions** → Definition + Architecture (10 marks)
* **2 questions** → Comparison + Use cases (10 marks)
* **2 questions** → Challenges + Future scope (10 marks)

If you answer like this → **25–30 marks guaranteed**.
